## What is it about?
If you have an idea for a HW product that could solve some real problem, and want to see the idea come to life, then you have come to right place.

This document layouts the roadmap, of how to achieve it in just 4 weeks! More than that you get you do it with others in the cohort.

> Submit your idea [here](https://github.com/daadu/idea2PoC/discussions/1), to do it with the cohort.

## Prerequisite
- An idea that you want to see in your hand
- Blocking at least 3-4 hour daily in you calendar for it
- Money for procuring required things (at this point you don't need much though)
- Have required skills to build it
	- You need to know enough, so that the project is not derailed because of the learning curve
	- I will publish more about various learning resources

## Week 1
- This week is all about planning and kick starting the project
- Here you should try to "build on paper" your project, conceptualise it, break down into various components or sub-systems, etc
- Make the list of items (components or tools) that needs to be purchase it
- Procure the item, either locally from shop or various e-commerce websites
	- For electronic components, there is a [great list of e-commerce vendors compiled by the Makerville Community](https://wiki.makerville.io/docs/Lists/ecommerce-vendors), shoutout to [Anuj Deshpande](https://twitter.com/anujdeshpandey) for this lovely resource.

## Week 2
- This week, you should start building things.
- For your software, write the code without requiring actual hardware
	- Use fake sensor data wherever required
	- Use "Serial.out" wherever you want an actuator to do something
- For your circuit, use component data-sheets to design it
	- Make schematic or circuit diagram first, then try to build it
	- For building the actual circuit there are multiple options
		- BreadBoard - this is the most easy and flexible option, any mistake could be easily reverted
		- PerfBoard - this will give you compact board, you can even start wiring it without the actual components.
		- PCB - only do this if you want more than 1 layer circuit, you can fabricate it with various DIY method or could give it a professional PCB fabricator.
- For your enclosure or housing
	- Try to be imaginative here - use foam sheets, shoe box, pencil box, etc.
	- Can use ready-made enclosures for electronics project
	- Can design custom enclosure for 3D printing or laser cutting
- At the end of the week you should be fabricating some of it - 3D printing, PCBs, enclosure

## Week 3
- This week, you will be build further and integrate various components 
- By this point your off-the-shelf component should have arrived
- This week we will integrate everything that we have order and built in week 2
- Fix any integration issues that are discovered
- At the end of the week we should have our PoC assembled

## Week 4
- This week, you will test it thoroughly and try to fix the issues as much as yoy can
- Test the PoC thoroughly and remove as much bug as possible
- Document whatever you have built - take photos, videos, write down learnings, things that could be improved, future scope, etc.
- Starting showing it to potential users and take their feedback
- That's it, you have done it. Congrats, you are a hero!!!
