## What is it about?
If you have an idea for a HW product that could solve some real problem, and want to see the idea come to life, then you have come to right place.

This document layouts the roadmap, of how to achieve it in just 4 weeks! More than that you get you do it with others in the cohort. Submit your idea in the repo's Issue board

## Prerequisite
- An idea that you want to see in your hand
- Blocking at least 3-4 hour daily in you calendar for it
- Money for procure things
- Have required skill to do it (I will publish more about it later)

## Week 1
- This week is all about planning and kick starting the project
- Here you should try to "build on paper" your project, conceptualise, break down into various components or sub-systems, etc
- Once you have decided on what exactly you will build, you will have to shop for the required components and tools
## Week 2
- You should start building things.
- For your software, write the code without requiring actual hardware
	- Use fake sensor data wherever required
	- Use "Serial.out" wherever you want an actuator to do something
- For your circuit, use component data-sheets to design it
	- Make schematic or circuit diagram first, then try to build it
	- For building the actual circuit there are multiple options
		- BreadBoard - this is the most easy and flexible option, any mistake could be easily reverted
		- PerfBoard - this will give you compact board, you can even start wiring it without the actual components.
		- PCB - only do this if you want more than 1 layer circuit, you can fabricate it with various DIY method or could give it a professional PCB fabricator.
- For your enclosure or housing
	- Try to be imaginative here - use foam sheets, shoe box, pencil box, etc.
	- Can use ready-made enclosures for electronics project
	- Can design custom enclosure for 3D printing or laser cutting
- At the end of the week you should be fabricating some of it - 3D printing, PCBs, enclosure
## Week 3
- By this point your off-the-shelf component should have arrived or arriving this week 
- This week we will integrate everything that we have order and built in week 2
- Fix any integration issues that are discovered
- At the end of the week we should have our PoC assembled

## Week 4
- This week we will test it thoroughly and try to fix the issues as much as we can
- Remove as much bug as possible
- If the device requires installation, we will do it
- Document whatever you have built - take photos, videos, write down learnings, things that could be improved, future scope, etc.
- That's it, you have done it. Congrats!!!
